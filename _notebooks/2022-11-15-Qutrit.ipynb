    "Recently I needed to decompose a general single-qutrit gate into elementary qutrit rotations, but was unable to find a ready-to-use result in the literature. After some time I gave up on searching and came up with a simple decomposition of the following form\n",

    "<img src=\"myimages/qutrit/su3su2.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of this post is to give an explicit algorithm for constructing this decomposition. If you want to cut to the chase, proceed to [summary and implementation](#summary). For the backstory start [here](#qutrit). For context I also cover Euler's decomposition for single-qubit gates and give a brief motivation below.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, why care about qutrits? Well, first thing to note is that they exist. Most quantum  systems in the real world, in contrast to quantum computing textbooks, are not two-level. Qutrits (three-level systems) and, more generally, qudits (d-dimensional systems) are omnipresent. Trapped ion quantum computers give one example where qudits naturally arise, see e.g. [https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08569](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08569). Another interesting example are superconducting qubits. In fact, a bare superconducting circuit is rather a harmonic oscillator and as such has infinitely many energy levels. Typically, an anharmonicity in the form of a Josephson junction is introduced, which allows to decouple the two lowest energy levels from the rest to give the familiar superconducting qubit. However, the higher energy levels are still there and can be fruitfully exploited.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a theorist, more levels is a blessing. More states fit into the system of the same size (for example dimension of the qutrit state space scales as $3^n$ instead of $2^n$ for a qubit system) opening up novel optimization possibilities, here is just one example [https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08973](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08973). An experimentator probably has mixed feelings about higher levels, because they are typically associated more noise and calibration overhead. Exploiting higher levels is therefore an promising yet challenging possibility. There are already many proofs of concept, see e.g. this result on using the third level in a superconducting circuit to improve the fidelity of the Toffoli gate [https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00558](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00558)."

For example, it can be used to deduce a minimum amount of $CNOT$ gates necessary to compile an arbitrary $n$-qubit unitary, as I discussed [here](https://idnm.github.io/blog/machine%20learning/compilation/qiskit/paper%20review/2021/07/22/Machine-learning-compilation-of-quantum-circuits.html#Theoretical-lower-bound-and-quantum-Shannon-decomposition)).\n",

    "\n",
    "However, decompositions like $XZX$ are special in a sense that they are examples of Cartan (aka KAK) decompositions, hinging on the structure of the underlying $su(2)$ algebra. Decompositions of two-qubit gates into $CNOT$ gates and single-qubit rotations is another important example where KAK arise. I will not cover the subject here, but can recommend a quite readable introduction with applications to quantum gates [https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0010100](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0010100).\n",

    "1. Cut out of matrix $U$ a $2\\times2$ submatrix $A$ and find its singular value decomposition $A=V \\Sigma W$.\n",
    "1. Factor out global phases from matrices $V$ and $W$ and denote $V=e^{i\\phi_V}V_0, W=e^{i\\phi_W}W_0$.\n",

    "1. Note also that $U$ does not change under transformation $V'\\to V' R_Z(2\\phi), W'\\to R_Z(-2\\phi)W', H'\\to R_Z(-\\phi) H' R_Z(\\phi)$.  This can be used to fix one degree of freedom in either $V', H'$ or $W'$.\n",
