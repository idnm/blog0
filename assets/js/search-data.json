            "content": "Entanglement . So what is entanglement? Entanglement is what entangled states have. What are those? Take two spins. The state . begin{equation} frac1{ sqrt{2}} Big(| uparrow uparrow rangle+| downarrow downarrow rangle Big) label{bell} end{equation}is your canonical example of an entangled stated. In contrast, all the states below are unentangled begin{align} | uparrow uparrow rangle, qquad | downarrow uparrow rangle, qquad frac1{ sqrt{2}}| uparrow rangle Big( uparrow rangle-| downarrow rangle Big), qquad frac1{ sqrt{2}} Big(| uparrow rangle-| downarrow rangle Big) Big( uparrow rangle+| downarrow rangle Big) label{unen} end{align} . The difference between eqref{bell} and eqref{unen} is that all latter states are actually products of the form $| psi_1 rangle | psi_2 rangle$ while the state eqref{bell} can not be represented in such form. You can define entangled states by this property of not being factorizible into wavefunctions of consistuent spins. . A perfectly reasonable question to ask is &quot;so what&quot;? Why are entangled states special? Personally I was aware of this formal aspect of entanglement for years, but I only asked the latter pragmatic question when exposed to quantum computations. Answers one can give to this &quot;so what&quot; question are numerous and most of them very interesting. I will only consider two. . In an entangled states the qubits are fundamentally connected . One need some qualifiers to explain this. .",

This comment solved my problem! | You need to edit _pages/about.md to customize the way your &quot;about&quot; page is displayed. | To customize the front page you need to edit index.html. This is literally written on the front page of your blog, but I have not noticed it for a while. | Initially a lot of troubleshooting is needed to get the appearance of the blog I wanted. Commiting and waiting for the online web page to set up is slowing this down. Here is an official guide on how to setup a live preview of your blog locally. One minor point that was a problem for me is that the default server https://127.0.0.1:4000 was not correct.
