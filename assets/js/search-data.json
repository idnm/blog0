            "content": "Entanglement . So what is entanglement? Entanglement is what entangled states have. What are those? Take two spins. The state . begin{equation} frac1{ sqrt{2}} Big(| uparrow uparrow rangle+| downarrow downarrow rangle Big) label{bell} end{equation}is your canonical example of an entangled stated. In contrast, all the states below are unentangled begin{align} | uparrow uparrow rangle, qquad | downarrow uparrow rangle, qquad frac1{ sqrt{2}}| uparrow rangle Big( uparrow rangle-| downarrow rangle Big), qquad frac1{ sqrt{2}} Big(| uparrow rangle-| downarrow rangle Big) Big( uparrow rangle+| downarrow rangle Big) label{unen} end{align} . The difference between eqref{bell} and eqref{unen} is that all latter states are actually products of the form $| psi_1 rangle | psi_2 rangle$ while the state eqref{bell} can not be represented in such form. You can define entangled states by this property of not being factorizible into wavefunctions of consistuent spins. . A perfectly reasonable question to ask is &quot;so what&quot;? Why are entangled states special? Personally I was aware of this formal aspect of entanglement for years, but I only asked the latter pragmatic question when exposed to quantum computations. Answers one can give to this &quot;so what&quot; question are numerous and most of them very interesting. I will only consider two. . In an entangled states the qubits are fundamentally connected . One need some qualifiers to explain this. .",

            "title": "How was this blog was set up?",
            "content": "Why fastpages? . After deciding to start a scientific blog I was looking for an appropriate technical solution. My main requirements were . Ease of set up. | Ease of writing posts. | Decent support of $ LaTeX$. | Support of code snippets. | . After some search I decided to try out fastpages. I have a very limited understanding of the stack that fastpages use, so I treat it as a magic box. The magic box was easy for me to install while other bullet points are addressed all at once since fastpages allows to generate a post from a jupyter notebook. Although jupyter notebook is not exactly my favorite $ LaTeX$ editor it still much better than many other options and a good overall compromise. So essentially with fastpages you can write your posts in jupyter notebook, then commit to your github repository and the content will automatically be hosted at your domain on github pages. . Caveats . Following official installation worked smoothly for me. While customizing the blog further for my purposes there were several things that did not work right of the box of took some time to find out how to change: . Solved . I wanted to use numbered $ LaTeX$ equations with hyperlinks, which are not easily supported. This comment solved my problem! | You need to edit _pages/about.md to customize the way your &quot;about&quot; page is displayed. | To customize the front page you need to edit index.html. This is literally written on the front page of your blog, but I have not noticed it for a while. | Initially a lot of troubleshooting is needed to get the appearance of the blog I wanted. Commiting and waiting for the online web page to set up is super-slow. Here is an official guide on how to setup a live preview of your blog locally. One minor point that was a problem for me is that the default local server for blog preview https://127.0.0.1:4000 was not correct. After running sudo make server one of the outputs that jekyll produces is Server address: http://0.0.0.0:4000/blog/ which was the correct address for the live preview of my blog. | Not solved . On the web page the display equations of $ LaTeX$ have fluctuations in size which does not look good. |",
